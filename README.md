This project focuses on the implementation of a computer vision model for number plate detection. The core of this work involves using the ResNet50 model to accurately identify and locate vehicle number plates, 
              even in challenging conditions such as blurry or hazy images. Developed as a group project at Bourneomuth University, our solution showcases a practical application of deep learning in image processing.

The project utilizes a dataset of Indian license plates for training and evaluation. The process involves image preprocessing, model training, and post-processing steps to ensure accurate detection.
The final solution is designed to be both efficient and robust, demonstrating key principles of computer vision and machine learning.

This project was a collaborative effort. My teammates are following:
->Rome Keizer Medina Delmo (s5325731)
->Hassan Behbahani Pour (s5732792)

We all contributed to the overall development of this project. My primary task was focused on the final part, including the modeling and analysis.
